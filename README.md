# NeuralNetwork-N-Bit-Parity

A NetLogo implementation of modular neural networks for the N-bit parity problem. 
The model includes automatically generating homogenous and heterogenous modular networks.
Homogenous: al subnetworks are the same shape.
Heterogenous: subnetworks are of different shapes. 

The model also includes training with backpropagation and simulated-annealing.
